# Musical Time Machine ðŸŽµ

A Python Script that allows the user to generate a Spotify playlist of Billboard's hot 100 from any day in the past to the present.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Make sure you have the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your computer (verify that the correct OS has been selected). 
* In order to make a Spotify playlist, you must have a Spotify account. If you do not have one, please sign up for free here: http://spotify.com/signup/.
* Once you've made an account, log in and go to the [developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). Here you will create a new Spotify app.
* Soon after the Spotify app is created, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into the main.py.


### Installing and Running the program

* Download and extract the ZIP file from the [repository](https://github.com/aaronowusu/musical_time_machine.git).
* Make sure you replace the place holders with **YOUR** Client ID and Client Secret after making a new Spotify app.
* Run the main.py file as you would any other Python script (.py) file.
